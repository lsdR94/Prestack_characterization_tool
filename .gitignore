# To prevent committing changes to the development tools configuration files
# create a .gitignore_global file at the User folder containing the location to these files
# and then run
# git config --global core.excludesfile '~/.gitignore_global'
# to tell git to exclude these files from version control.
# In this manner we don't pollute the shared .gitignore file
